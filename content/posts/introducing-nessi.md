# Introducing Nessi.dev: The Delta-Native Data Quality Engine

In today's data-driven world, maintaining data quality isn't just a luxury—it's a necessity. Modern data teams face unprecedented challenges with schema drift, broken pipelines, and silent anomalies, particularly when working with Delta Lake. These issues aren't just inconvenient; they can lead to costly mistakes and lost opportunities.

## The Challenge

Modern data teams are drowning in a sea of data quality issues:

- **Schema Drift**: Unexpected changes in data structure that break downstream processes
- **Pipeline Failures**: Silent breakdowns that go unnoticed until it's too late
- **Data Anomalies**: Subtle irregularities that compromise data integrity

And when you're working with Delta Lake, these challenges become even more pronounced.

## Enter Nessi.dev

What we needed wasn't another dashboard or generic data quality tool. We needed a CLI-first, fast, focused engine that actually understands how Delta Lake works. That's why we built Nessi.dev.

## What is Nessi.dev?

Nessi.dev is a Delta-native data quality and observability engine built for data engineers. It runs locally or in CI/CD, works across cloud storage layers (S3, Azure Blob, GCS), and gives you real insight into your tables — without requiring Spark, JVM, or endless configuration.

### With One Command, You Can:

- Profile Delta tables with stats, nulls, histograms, uniqueness, and type checks
- Validate schema consistency and version history
- Detect anomalies (outliers, spikes, trend changes, oscillations)
- Run custom rules (YAML, SQL, or Python)
- Generate clean HTML/PDF reports with quality scoring
- Set up alerts via email, Slack, or Prometheus
- Integrate with dbt, Airflow, GitHub Actions, or any CI/CD system

## Why Nessi.dev Exists

Most data quality tools fall into one of two categories:

1. **Dashboard-heavy platforms**: Pretty charts, but disconnected from how engineers actually work
2. **Rigid rule engines**: Limited insight, no profiling, and zero context

### What Makes Nessi Different:

- Built in Go for performance, simplicity, and portability
- Works directly on Delta Lake log files (no black box)
- CLI-first, DevOps-friendly, and easy to embed into any pipeline
- Optional Python extensions if you want ML-based anomaly detection

## Quick Start: Profile Check

Try this simple command to get started:

```bash
nessi profile s3://my-datalake/users --report
```

You'll instantly get:
- Statistical summary (min/max/null/unique per column)
- Partition layout and optimization hints
- Distribution histograms
- HTML report with drill-downs
- Quality scorecard

### Need Validation?

```bash
nessi validate --rules rules.yaml s3://my-datalake/users
```

Supports predefined rules (null, range, regex, enum) and custom logic — via YAML, SQL, or Python.

## Key Features

Nessi.dev isn't just fast. It's deeply integrated with how real data teams work:

✅ Delta Lake version control  
✅ Schema diff and rollback up to 30 days  
✅ Anomaly detection using trend deviation, z-score, IQR  
✅ Lineage-aware RCA (Root Cause Analysis)  
✅ Freshness + SLA checks with alert routing  
✅ Grafana + Prometheus integration  
✅ Cross-cloud support (AWS, Azure, GCP)  
✅ Security-first: RBAC, JWT auth, audit logs, rate limiting  

And it's all containerized with Docker — no Spark, no JVM, no bloat.

## Integration Ecosystem

Nessi works seamlessly with your existing tools:

- **dbt**: Run Nessi checks on models, tags, and downstream dependencies
- **Airflow**: Trigger profiling and validation tasks as operators
- **GitHub Actions**: Fail builds if tables drift or rules fail
- **Grafana**: Visualize table health trends in real time
- **Slack/Email/Teams**: Get alerted before downstream consumers complain

## Roadmap

Here's what's coming next:

- Freshness SLA dashboard
- Public rule and plugin hub
- Unity Catalog support
- More RCA automation
- Community-contributed report templates

## Ready to Try It?

No signup. No credit card. Just visibility.

```bash
docker run nessi/nessi:latest profile s3://my-datalake/users
```
